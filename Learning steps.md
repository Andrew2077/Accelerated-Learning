## 1. Setting a goal

- Long-term goal (3 to 5 years): career focus
- Medium-term (3 to 5 weeks): next topic or certificate
- Short-term, Daily grind

---

## 2. Mindset

- always believe u can do something
- there's always a window for growth and improve
- always find a motivator to stay consistent

---

## 3. Process vs Outcome

- always focus on the process, not the outcome,
  - don't daydream
  - set a reminder, like a tone or something
  - regain focus whenever lost, that's how u keep learning
- you can control your actions, progress
- but you can't control the outcome
  - so focusing on the outcome when may lose us the progress
  - don't dream about the long-term outcome
  - always focus on doing small steps every day, and keep grinding, it's a grinding game now
  - don't lose trust in yourself when the outcome is not as u expected
  - become super at learning, set an identity
  - success builds success even if it's really small it's still a success

---

## 4. Staying Motivated

- achieving is the key, it's how we keep learning
- always look for something to do even if it's small, it's a progress

#### 4.2.3 Purpose

---

## 5. Habit Formation

> Power of habit, great book
>
> Atomic Habits, great book

- build a habit of your grinding time , How
- setting deadlines, follow them, but they are not crucial
- step 1: Make it obvious, what u need to learn and why
- step 2: make it attractive, start with a cop of coffee for example
- step 3: Make it easy to start, set a plan before going to sleep, and get the setup ready to study. get rid of your phone, distraction
- step 4: Make it satisfying,

## 6. Deliberate Practice

> look for more about that topic later

from a data scientist pov

- always have a plan
- don't repeat when un-needed
- don't spend much in the tut, learn then move to build projects

### 6.1. Plan

- 1.  Best practices, make sure u have learned that topic
- 2.  Stop, stop learning and start applying
- 3.  Focused action, Build a project
- 4.  Feedback, Self-assessment **look for a tool or a way**
- 5. Recovery -- when needed
- 6. repetition -- when needed

---

## 7. Flow **(VIP)**

Flow is the optimal state of performance when you feel your best and perform your best in flow, you get the full capacity of your skills "Being in the zone"

### 7.1. Flow cycle

- 1.  Struggle, when you feel uncomfortable about something, and **distractions** start to hit
- 2.  Release, you don't fall for distractions, for example taking a break for a few seconds, don't get distracted, take a deep breath, or better meditate for 30-60 seconds then go back to your problem
- 3.  Flow once you get back to your problem and feel more relaxed, not head blocked anymore the flow state hits, and you are at the peak of your performance
- 4.  Recovery, once you start to get out of flow, it's better to recover cause Flow consumes a lot of energy, replenish this energy and go for another flow session if you need, but better go take a rest or do something fun

### 7.2. Flow Triggers

flow can only arise when are all attention is focused on the present moment

1. complete focus on the present moment
2. Immediate feedback, -- taking a certification test
3. clear goal -- plan, or the next 30min task
4. the challenge skill ratio,, Hard task- 4% harder
5. Deep embodiment, my fav trigger--- learn by doing
6. Creativity-- reaching new idea or solving a new problem in the head

## 8. The top 3 secrets of Learning

> learning how to learn on Coursera

1. **Active Recall**: the biggest misunderstanding and how the memory really develops.
2. **Paced Repetitions**: the secret of permanent learning
3. **Abstraction**: how to make the mind manages the complexity of IT or whatever you're learning

### 8.1. Active recall

- Long-term memory develops by getting something out of the memory and not by putting something in
- practicing is very important
- forgetting is a prerequisite to learning
- explain it in your own words
  - explain it to someone
  - record it on your phone
  - write it down as documentation for someone else

### 8.2. Paced repetition

- focused and diffused mode
- to remember something it has to not be in your working memory. you must put some effort to remember it
- forgetting is prerequisite
- look for apps that help you learn and remember

### 8.3. Abstraction

- we cannot multi-task only work on one task
- we remember things better if we understand how it fits in the big picture, it will make the process of fetching that topic or that piece of knowledge much much easier

---

## 9. Splitting the skills

always do some analysis and take notes of what you a trying to learn, read about the concepts and skills that you will learn if you took that course or path

- concepts
- facts
- skills - procedures

---

## 10. Efficient Learning

- Reading is better than listening
- doing is better than watching
- "I see and I forget, I hear and I remember, I do and I understand"
- stop looking for shortcuts and get to work

---

## 11. Hand, Heart, Head

start by doing, it's much better to start doing something, ie getting in the struggle, building a relationship with the topic, then understanding it.
go hands-on first

---

## 12. Different Kinds of Materials

### 12.1. Books

the best method for a deep understanding of topics, ML, Deep learning, or math in general, books beats everything that needs deep understanding

### 12.2. on-hands

online learning from videos courses is another good method for learning, especially for programming Languages

### 12.3. Online material & projects

Projects are one of the best methods to learn something

---

## 13. Testing yourself _- you can skip-_

if you can test your level of understanding during the learning process it's okay, if you can't don't bother
Self-assessment can do that job for you.
it's recommended to find a self-assessment tool

---

## 14. The System **(VIP)**

Create a good system for your own progress

- write your guidelines, but don't dwell on them just a few lines before starting your learning block
- Scale or measurement, as we agreed focuses on the process, not the outcome
- your goal is to work on your project, and eventually, your project will be done
- Learning / Progress block
  - it's a 25 min of focused work - Flow 3 sessions of 25mins of focus or more
  - check Pomodoro system for info
  - here's some app that I use myself [PomoDoneApp](https://pomodoneapp.com), it's great to notice your distraction
  - work with a to-do list
  - reword system

---

## 15. Making the system Habit

- plan ahead and mostly in blocks, cause with finishing each block you'll have enough dopamine to keep on studying and learning
- working with a plan is great to keep track of what you learn
- Microsoft notebook is great for that, and for to-do lists too
- but don't plan too much ahead just what are you going to do for just tomorrow
- don't plan many things, remember to make it easy to do and expand when finishing
- spend breaks in adjusting your plan, checking for stuff, or checking your phone
- turn off everything, turn on focus mode on your PC and get to learn
- once you are done write down what you learn it's always great to take a look at what you have achieved
- but don't dwell in your greatness and just move to the next topic
- build your own daily grinding sessions

---

## 16. Summary

I haven't applied all these steps myself, but I have adjusted some and with time you will end up creating a system that works with you and benefits you the most.

1.  plan topics for weeks, details or small topics daily
2.  don't spend much time planning, just plan for the next day's topic
3.  make it easy then expand. if you have enough energy to expand
4.  use study blocks with an alarming app to feel the time flowing through for either working or distractions
5.  the process of self-assessment is difficult but with time you will manage, just remember to start slow on that topic. one good way to self-assessment is to measure the time takes you to build a specific project with a deep understanding of it
6.  try the flow cycle for better performance, cause it helps on deadends or struggles
7.  Focus on the process, not the outcome
8.  don't dwell on your achievements move on to the next one
9.  just recover, but don't take much time recovering
10. remember to recharge your energy, drink water
11. the most important skill is to get started. being able to start doing something after planning it, is hard to just push yourself on it, better plan before going to sleep and start your day by following this plan
12. you will feel resistance to do work, it's the barrier blocking you from learning.. but breaking this barrier is easy just force yourself to follow the plan u have.. and within minutes you get into the focused or flow mode of learning
13. Just start
14. repeat
